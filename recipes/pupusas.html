        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>In a container, add the chicharrón along with the cup of water and let it hydrate for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, take it to a processor or blender and grind until it has a well compact and ground consistency.</p>
        <p>Add at this point the mozzarella, the onion, garlic and chili previously fried in oil, salt and pepper and mix well, reserve</p>
        <p>In another container, proceed to prepare the dough, for this add the flour, the salt along with the remaining 3 cups of water and begin to knead until it is firm, smooth and does not stick to your hands.</p>
        <p>Then take a portion and form a ball with the dough then make a hole inside</p>
        <p>Add a tablespoon and a half of the chicharrón with cheese filling, twist the pupusa removing the excess and give it an oval shape with the palm of your hands</p>
        <p>Place the pupusa on a griddle previously heated over medium heat and grill on both sides</p>
        <p>Repeat the procedure with the rest of the dough.</p>
